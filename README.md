# PokeRogue-Autokey
A quick program to automatically input key inputs for things like Daily run, now with a GUI

This is something I made quickly. If there are problems, I'll work them out. 

The .exe is in the dist folder.

USE 5X SPEED 

This is meant to run after all the tutorial messages are done, and ideally, when you catch a Pokemon, it won't be the first time you catch it. 

Don't set the delay too low; certain events in the game take a few seconds to process, even at 5x speed.
Like forgetting a move or a multi-hit attack.

The goal behind the "Start Recording Keys" is to remember the keys pressed when you run the Daily help posts that show up on the subreddit, so no one has to do it more than once if everyone decides to share. Or you just do it for yourself once, and let it run over and over. Remember, you need to also record the keys pressed to back out of the run, overwrite the run, etc. 

THIS CAN TRACK YOUR KEYSTROKES, but only if you click the button. It also only places them in the Key Input box. You can choose to save them and load them if you made a mistake typing them out yourself or something. This makes a file to record it from, but you can go delete it yourself afterwards if you want. 

Have fun.
