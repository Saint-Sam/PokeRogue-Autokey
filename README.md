# PokeRogue-Autokey
Made to record and execute key inputs for use in Pokerogue. Works best for Daily run.

This is something I made quickly. If there are problems, I'll work them out. 

The .exe is in the dist folder.

USE 5X SPEED 

This is meant to run after all the tutorial messages are cleared and after catching a 'mon for the first time.

Don't set the delay too low; certain events in the game take a few seconds to process, even at 5x speed.
eg. forgetting a move or a multi-hit attack.

"Start Recording Keys" is intended keep track of the keys pressed when you play the Daily run. The ideal recording starts at the first encounter with the curser on "Fight".

THIS CAN TRACK YOUR KEYSTROKES, but only if you click Save Keys. It only places them in the Key Input box. You can save and load the keys you pressed. Autokey makes a file to record it from, but you can delete it yourself afterward. It gets overwritten each time you hit Save Keys.

Have fun.
